# The Chamelot: OpenRTP Engine ��🎰

**OpenRTP Engine** is a state-of-the-art, high-precision PID control system designed for stabilizing Return to Player (RTP) in gaming environments. It combines high-speed mathematical certainty with a natural, "human-like" payment feel through its unique **Dual-Path Weighted Memory** architecture.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 🧠 Dual-Path Weighted Memory (The "Balanced Brain")
OpenRTP solves the classic trade-off between long-term precision and short-term responsiveness:
- **Base Integrator (Precision Path):** A 100% accurate memory path that tracks every cent of house profit. It ensures zero steady-state error, meaning the machine will *always* converge perfectly to the target RTP, no matter how many millions of spins are run.
- **Reactive Integrator (Response Path):** A short-term, weighted path that reacts 2x more strongly to recent events (like Jackpots). It uses a 0.99 decay factor to ensure the machine responds "emotionally" to recent high-wins without being permanently stuck in the past.

### ⚖️ Asymmetric Stabilization
Tuned for real-world casino psychology:
- **Stealth Tightening (-0.9):** Recover house margins subtly without making the game feel "dead."
- **Aggressive Loosening (+2.0):** Allow the machine to pay out generously after a big event to maintain player engagement and "Hot Streak" sensations.

### 🌪️ Chaos Mode Stress Testing
The engine is verified for extreme volatility. Launch a **10 Million Spin** test with random bets ($1 to $3,000+) and watch the PID maintain sub-0.5% error margins.
